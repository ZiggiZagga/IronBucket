# üõ°Ô∏è IronBucket

**IronBucket** is a zero-trust, identity-aware proxy that wraps any S3-compatible object store with Git-managed, policy-as-code access control. Enforce fine-grained permissions using OIDC/OAuth2 identity, attribute-based rules, and GitOps-style auditability.

> üîê Secure by default.  
> üß© Pluggable with any object store.  
> üß≠ Governed by Git.

## üß© What's Strong About IronBucket ‚ú®

| **Aspect** | **Why it matters** |
|-----------|--------------------|
| **GitOps-native policy store** | Treating access rules like code‚Äîbranches, PRs, rollbacks‚Äîpulls security into the engineering workflow. No more brittle IAM JSON or scattered ACLs. |
| **Zero-trust, identity-aware proxy** | By terminating OIDC/OAuth at the gateway, IronBucket decouples identity from the store‚Äôs own ACL model and provides a unified RBAC/ABAC layer across S3, MinIO, Ceph, etc. |
| **Drop-in S3 API compatibility** | Keeping the wire protocol untouched means zero rewrites. It works just like Envoy's service mesh adoption playbook. |
| **Clear inspiration from proven OSS projects** | IronBucket borrows branching from Project Nessie and tag-based enforcement from Polaris‚Äîstanding on solid OSS shoulders rather than inventing in a vacuum. |

## üß† Open Engineering Challenges (Join the Mission)

üöß This project is completely new almost no code is written yet. If you‚Äôve ever wanted to help shape something from day zero, **now‚Äôs your chance**.

Here are some of the toughest, most rewarding problems waiting for builders like you:

| **Challenge** | **Why it matters & how you could help** |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| ‚öôÔ∏è **Performance tuning** | Every object fetch includes auth + policy evaluation. Help benchmark latency, optimize in-memory caching, and explore async audit strategies. |
| üèóÔ∏è **High availability (HA)** | A gateway outage shouldn't mean a data outage. Design resilient HA topologies using stateless pods, load balancers, or sidecar approaches. |
| üõ°Ô∏è **Policy engine evolution** | Should we use YAML? Rego? Cedar? Help shape the policy language, embed a battle-tested engine, and unlock tooling support. |
| üè∑Ô∏è **Metadata & tag enforcement** | ABAC requires clean, immutable tags. Build CLI tools or upload hooks to guarantee metadata consistency and prevent drift. |
| üè¢ **Multi-tenant isolation** | Secure SaaS-style deployments need namespacing, quotas, and noisy-neighbor controls. Architect strong tenant boundaries from the ground up. |

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Wins to Tighten the Story

- üìò **Publish a threat model**: Diagram trust boundaries (client ‚Üí gateway ‚Üí policy engine ‚Üí store) and highlight mitigations.
- üß™ **Policy dry-run mode**: Let teams simulate access before merging changes to `main`.
- üíª **CLI for dev laptops**: A lightweight dev proxy to test policies locally without prod risk.
- üß© **Pluggable storage adapters**: Start with S3/MinIO, but leave room for Wasabi, Backblaze, or future targets.
- üß± **Roadmapped integrations**: Explicitly support Keycloak/Auth0, GitHub/GitLab, and CI/CD hooks so users know what‚Äôs stable.

## üìú Writing Policies

IronBucket policies live in Git as YAML or JSON files. They define who can do *what* to *which* resource, under *which* conditions.

```yaml
id: read-access-to-project-x
description: Allow devs to read Project X data
subjects:
  - group: dev-team
actions: [GET, HEAD]
resources:
  - bucket: project-x-data
    prefix: /raw/
conditions:
  - attribute: region
    operator: equals
    value: eu-central-1
```

## üìã Example Policy Templates

#### üß™ Read-Only Access for QA Team
```yaml
id: qa-read-access
description: Allow QA team to read test data
subjects:
  - group: qa
actions: [GET, HEAD]
resources:
  - bucket: test-data
    prefix: /
```

#### üîê Restricted Upload for Developers (EU Only)

```yaml
id: dev-upload-eu
description: Developers can upload only to EU buckets
subjects:
  - group: dev
actions: [PUT, POST]
resources:
  - bucket: app-logs
    prefix: /dev/
conditions:
  - attribute: region
    operator: equals
    value: eu-central-1
```

#### ‚ùå Block Public Access
```yaml
id: deny-public-access
description: Explicitly deny anonymous access to all resources
subjects:
  - user: anonymous
actions: [*]
resources:
  - bucket: '*'
    prefix: '/'
effect: deny
```

## Minimal Working Example: Quickstart Guide

Follow these steps to spin up a minimal working demo of the IronBucket ecosystem:

1. **Clone All Repositories**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ZiggiZagga/IronBucket.git
   git clone https://github.com/ZiggiZagga/Sentinel-Gear.git
   git clone https://github.com/ZiggiZagga/Claimspindel.git
   git clone https://github.com/ZiggiZagga/Buzzle-Vane.git
   git clone https://github.com/ZiggiZagga/Brazz-Nossel.git
   ```

2. **Start Core Identity and Policy Services**
   - Navigate to the steel-hammer folder inside the IronBucket repository:
     ```sh
     cd IronBucket/steel-hammer
     ```
   - Environmentvariables:     
     ```sh
     pwd
     ```
     Put the path into the double exports below and export the variable `DOCKER_FILES_HOMEDIR`.
      ```sh
     export DOCKER_FILES_HOMEDIR=""
     ```
   - Launch Keycloak (on port 7081) and Postgres (on port 5432) via Docker Compose:
     ```sh
     docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build
     ```
   - Wait for the services to start.  
   - Verify that Keycloak is running by navigating to [http://localhost:7081](http://localhost:7081) in your browser.
     

3. **Start the Java Applications in your IDE (in order):**
   - before you can run the Java Applications you have to make sure they all have access to the following environment variables:
     ```sh
     export IDP_PROVIDER_HOST="localhost:7081"
     export IDP_PROVIDER_PROTOCOL="http"
     export IDP_PROVIDER_REALM="dev"
     ```
   - Start **[Buzzle-Vane](https://github.com/ZiggiZagga/Buzzle-Vane)**
   - Start **[Sentinel-Gear](https://github.com/ZiggiZagga/Sentinel-Gear)**
   - Start **[Claimspindel](https://github.com/ZiggiZagga/Claimspindel)**
   - Start **[Brazz-Nossel](https://github.com/ZiggiZagga/Brazz-Nossel)**

   *(You need to do this in your favorite IDE.)*

4. **Verify the Setup**
   - Open [http://localhost:7085/s3](http://localhost:7085/s3) to access the Sentinel-Gear endpoint.
   - You should be redirected to the Keycloak login page.

5. **Test Users**
   The system comes preconfigured with two example users:
   | Username | Role  | Password   |
   |----------|-------|------------|
   | bob      | dev   | bobP@ss    |
   | alice    | admin | aliceP@ss  |

---


- **Sentinel-Gear** authenticates and validates inbound requests.
- **Claimspindel** inspects identity claims and routes based on dynamic policies.
- **Buzzle-Vane** handles service registration and discovery, identity-aware.
- **Brazz-Nossel** proxies S3 storage access, enforcing the same identity and policy standards.

## **Goto Production fast strategy**

### üß¨ From **[Project Nessie](https://github.com/projectnessie/nessie)**
**Git-style branching & commit semantics**  
- ‚ú≥Ô∏è _Inspiration_: Nessie‚Äôs Git-like model for data  
- ‚úÖ _How we use it_: Apply similar mechanics to version **access control policies**‚Äîsupporting policy branches (`dev`, `stage`, `prod`), commit logs, and rollback

**Commit metadata & audit**  
- ‚õèÔ∏è _Inspiration_: Nessie tracks user actions across branches  
- ‚úÖ _IronBucket fit_: Record "who edited what" in policy changes for traceability

---

### üõ°Ô∏è From **[Apache Polaris](https://github.com/apache/polaris)**
**Fine-grained permissions + federation model**  
- ‚ú≥Ô∏è _Inspiration_: Polaris has multi-tenant RBAC and federated query layers  
- ‚úÖ _IronBucket fit_: Adapt its role definition granularity and hierarchical access controls for **multi-project S3 namespaces**

**Attribute-tag-aware enforcement**  
- ‚õèÔ∏è _Inspiration_: Data tags + policy enforcement at query time  
- ‚úÖ _IronBucket fit_: We apply tags to objects and enforce ABAC rules at access time (e.g., `user.region == object.tag.region`)

---

### üß≠ From **[Unity Catalog](https://github.com/unitycatalog/unitycatalog)** (conceptual since it‚Äôs closed-source)
**Centralized governance with identity awareness**  
- ‚ú≥Ô∏è _Inspiration_: Global identity-based permissions across workspaces  
- ‚úÖ _IronBucket fit_: Global RBAC/ABAC rule definitions, synced across services via Git, linked to real identity provider attributes

**Lineage-as-a-feature**  
- While full lineage isn‚Äôt core to us, we _could_ log object usage and produce lineage-style metadata for access‚Äîfor audit or downstream triggers

---

### üöÄ From **[Gravitino](https://github.com/apache/gravitino)**
**Schema-level metadata & governance layer**  
- ‚ú≥Ô∏è _Inspiration_: Gravitino abstracts metadata across catalogs  
- ‚úÖ _IronBucket fit_: Although we‚Äôre staying out of table land, **Gravitino‚Äôs catalog of governance objects** could inspire our **policy object model**‚Äîdefining storage buckets, roles, and constraints in a unified structure

---

### üß© Synthesis for IronBucket
If we align all that into our domain, here's what we'd implement:
- Git-backed policy store with Nessie-like branches and commits
- Attribute-driven access control via Polaris-style tags + ABAC
- Unified identity layer inspired by Unity Catalog, aware of OIDC roles, groups, entitlements
- Governance object graph modeled a bit like Gravitino, but constrained to buckets, prefixes, and roles‚Äînot tables or schemas
